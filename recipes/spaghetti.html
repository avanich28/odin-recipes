            <h2 class="main">Description</h2>
            <p>
                This Scallop Spaghetti with a cream sauce by <em>Chef John</em> is easy to cook and prepare.
                Cooking scallops a bit longer gives the texture more tender and moist.
                After putting with the sherry sauce the dish is more fragrant and looks delicious.

            <h2 class="main">Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or 1 minute less than directed on the package.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for about 1 minute. Toss to turn.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add butter and stir scallops until butter melts. Stir in garlic.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes. Stir in sherry and cook and stir until alcohol cooks off, about 1 minute.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. Add 1/2 of the chopped parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 minute.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Remove from heat. Garnish generously with grated cheese. Add the rest of the parsley. Serve in warm bowls.</li>
            </ol>
